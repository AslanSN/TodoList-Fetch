# To-do list with React
Exercise where we had to copy with our own code this template: 
[![Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breatheco-de/exercise-todo-list/master/preview.gif)](http://https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breatheco-de/exercise-todo-list/master/preview.gif)

## My code
So I did all the functions shown plus a dark button to erase all the task list. 
I used only JavaScript with React and Bootstrap.
There is the result:

[![Aslan's To-do List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AslanSN/todo-list/master/src/TodoList.png "Aslan's To-do List")](http://https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AslanSN/todo-list/master/src/TodoList.png "Aslan's To-do List")

All the functions are working and the familly font for the main list and the input is _Flamenco_ in honor of my teacher @Manu Martinez.

### Run the code
Open your workspace cloning or, if you have GitPod installed, just click the button.

Then **install node.js**. For this you must type this in your **terminal**:

`npm install`

Now just run it typing:

`npm run start`
